	<h2> Biography of Elaine Chestler:</h2>
	<h4> Hello! My name is Elaine Chestler. I'm currently in the second semester of my sophomore year at Tufts University in Medford, MA. I originally hail from Minneapolis, MN but some of my other favorite cities to visit are Portland, OR, and Chicago, IL. At Tufts, I'm studying Civil Engineering with a minor in Architectural Studies. </h4>
	<h4> When I have free time, I enjoy listening to music, riding my bike, hiking, traveling, practicing yoga, drinking tea, speaking Spanish, knitting, photography, watercolor painting, playing the flute and the ukelele, and playing with my puppies. </h4>
